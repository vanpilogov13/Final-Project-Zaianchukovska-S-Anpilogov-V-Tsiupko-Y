# Final Project - Operational Margin Calculator
## Overview
This program allows you to upload files in csv format, read them and calculate indicators based on the data found in the tables

From the added additional features:
- added function to normalize column names, because some of them have spaces, confusing registers, etc.
- the program clears the console, which makes using it more pleasant
- added function for automatic search of necessary columns, if the program doesn't find them, it asks for their names.
- added validation for loading existing files to avoid errors

## Functions
